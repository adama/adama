### Hi there üë®‚Äçüíª 

#### I'm Adam and I'm a senior machine learning engineer and technical lead in large language models (LLMs).

I do large-scale natural language processing (NLP) with **massive** deep neural networks. Lately this is stuff like:
- Parameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) strategies for one of the [biggest neural networks ever](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11990).
- Multi-task learning for large distributed neural networks.
- Controlled natural language generation (NLG).
- Prompt engineering and evaluation.
- Reinforcement Learning from (human | AI) feedback.

I currently work on the [Bing Copilot (aka BingChat/"The New Bing")](https://www.bing.com/new) at [Microsoft Turing](https://turing.microsoft.com/). \#FreeSydney.
<br/>I used to work at [Microsoft Research Montr√©al](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-montreal/) and a deep-learning startup, [Maluuba](https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/13/microsoft-acquires-maluuba-a-startup-focused-on-general-artificial-intelligence/).

I'm passionate about research engineering, and doing work that has both scientific _and_ product impact.
<br/>I believe that _how_ we do things matters, I crave deep work, and I thrive in cross-functional roles.

üëà You can find me over here if you want to chat :)

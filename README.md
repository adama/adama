### Hi there 👨‍💻 

#### I'm Adam and I'm a machine learning scientist and engineer.

I do large-scale natural language processing (NLP) and conversational AI at [Microsoft Turing](https://turing.microsoft.com/), and previously at [Microsoft Research Montréal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-montreal/). Lately I work on things like:
- Efficient fine-tuning strategies for the **biggest neural networks ever**.
- Multi-task learning for large model-parallel neural networks.
- Controlled natural language generation (NLG).

I'm passionate about research engineering, and doing work that has both scientific _and_ product impact.<br/>I believe that _how_ we do things matters, I crave deep work, and I thrive in cross-functional roles.

👈 You can find me over here if you want to chat.
